## Overview
The ASCII Art Generator is a program written in Go that takes a string as input and outputs a graphic representation of the string using ASCII characters. This program is designed to create visually appealing representations of text using only ASCII characters.

## Usage
To use the ASCII Art Generator, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory where the repository is cloned.
3. Build the program using the Go compiler:
4. Run the program from the command line, providing a string as an argument: Remember to enclose the string in a double or single quotation marks
5. The program will output the graphic representation of the input string using ASCII characters.

## Example
Suppose you want to create an ASCII representation of the word "hello". You would run the program with the following command:
go run . "hello"
The output would be:
```
 _              _   _          
| |            | | | |         
| |__     ___  | | | |   ___   
|  _ \   / _ \ | | | |  / _ \  
| | | | |  __/ | | | | | (_) | 
|_| |_|  \___| |_| |_|  \___/  
                               
  ```
